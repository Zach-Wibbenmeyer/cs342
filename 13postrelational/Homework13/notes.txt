CS342 - Homework 13

2).

	a).
		KVLite is a Key-Value NoSQL database.
		
	b).
		I would use a Graph system since each of the individual nodes are pretty small objects
		but there are a lot of relationships of different types between all of them.
		
	c).
		Yes I can. However, I would not recommend doing it because it is both memory expensive
		and computationally expensive.
	
	d).
		Since there is no schema in this homework, you can pretty much insert any key-value pair anywhere you wish,
		and there is no way for the computer to verify what is correct. A schema is usually set in place to provide structure,
		so the user cannot enter anything he/she wishes and get away with it.
