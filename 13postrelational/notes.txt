	a).
		store.put() stores a new record as the given key-value pair in a non-relational database.
		em.persist() stores a new record in a relational database.

	b).
		myHashTable.put() inserts a new key-value pair into a hash table, but the hash table does not have to be a non-relational database.
		It only stores the object for the time the program runs.

13.2).

	a).
		KVLite keys are strings that point to a certain record or field. It is also hierarchical, which means that the record and field map up directly.
		A relational database uses a unique key to identify a record, but it does not use a hierarchy, and it also does not include keys to
		get the fields in the records.

13.3)
	
	a). 
		A record on the many side of the join table would contain a key-value pair, like a movie having "movie/15486/-/director" -> "director/7894".
		The key is a normal field on the movie record, and the value is a key for a director record.

	b).
		This would be helpful if you possess a person object and the person object may or may not have an unknown nickname. If the nickname
		is known, then the key "person/<id>/-/nickname" would point to "<nickname>". Otherwise, if the nickname was unkown, then the empty value would be used.
