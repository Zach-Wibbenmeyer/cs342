1).
	a).
		I would say this relation is in 1NF, depending on how Author_name is used. It is definitely not in BCNF or 4NF.

	b).
		Book(ID (PK), bookTitle, bookTypeID (FK), publisherID (FK))
		BookType(ID (PK), bookType, listPrice)
		Author(ID (PK), authorName)
		BookAuthor(authorID (FK), bookID (FK), authorDescription)
		Publisher(ID (PK), publisherName)

		Functional Dependencies:
			bookID -> bookTypeID, publisherID
			bookTypeID -> bookType, listPrice
			authorID, bookID -> authorDescription
			publisherID -> publisherName
			authorID -> authorName

		Multivalued Dependencies:
			None

2).
	a).
		Possible candidate keys:
			Book_Name, Author, Edition, Year
			Book_Name, Author, Edition
			Book_Name, Author, Year

	b).
		It has said relation because if there is another author, then there must be an additional two rows instead of just one additional row in the relation.

	c).
		Book(ID (PK), name)
		Author(ID (PK), authorName)
		BookEdition(bookID (FK), edition, year)
		BookAuthor(bookID (FK), authorID (FK))

		Functional Dependencies:
			bookID -> bookName
			authorID -> authorName
			bookID, edition -> year
			edition -> year

		Multivalued Dependencies:
			None
