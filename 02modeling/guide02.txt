1a. E.F. Codd invented the relational data model. He did most of his work at IBM in the 1960's and 1970's.

1b.
	i. Relation - a set of n-tuples

	ii. Attribute - the name of a role played by some domain in the relation schema of a database.

	iii. Domain - data type that describes the types of values that can appear in an attribute.

	iv. n-tuple - an ordered list of n values where each value is an element of the domain or a special NULL value.

	v. NULL value - A special indicator in SQL to specify that a specific data value does not exist in the database.

	vi. primary key - a relational database table column designated to uniquely identify all table records.

	foreign key - a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another or the same table.

	candidate key - a column that can uniquely identify any database record without referencing other data

	super key - a set of of attributes where there are no two distinct tuples that have the same values for all relations assigned to that variable

	vii. referenced and referencing record - a record that is referenced with a foreign key by another record.

1c. Depending on the needs and structure of the database, tuples can either be ordered or unordered.

1d. You cannot have multiple values for the same attribute. You have to represent them with separate relations.
