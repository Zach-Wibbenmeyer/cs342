What I think will happen:

Query the movie table -> the two sessions will return the same result set.
Delete a movie and query the table -> the session which did not do the delete will not reflect the change.
Rollback and query -> both sessions will return the original result set.
Add a new movie and query -> the session which did not do the insert will not have the change.
Commit -> both sessions will be identical and reflect the changes, and each one will contain the newly added movie.


a).
	Oracle seems to utilize a session as a pseudo-transaction. Meaning, you are able to commit
	or rollback during the session to commit or drop changes that were made in the session so that the other
	sessions will begin to use the updated data.

b).
	Yes, you can. We did not create savepoints, but those would work similarily to commits, but would not end the current session.
	Therefore, we can implement these transaction properties inside of a session.
