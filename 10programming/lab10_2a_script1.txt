SELECT rank FROM Movie WHERE id = 238071;

-- Retrieves the Ocean's 11 movie's rank, which is 8.5

UPDATE Movie SET rank = 8.6 WHERE id = 238071;

-- Adds 0.1 to the Ocean's 11 record's rank

SELECT rank FROM Movie WHERE id = 238071;

-- We expect to see 8.6
-- The actual result depends on which thread runs its update second, which causes the first's update to be lost (lost update problem).
