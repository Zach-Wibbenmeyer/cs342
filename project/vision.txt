I would love to do something along the lines of a database for a local concert venue (i.e. The Orbit Room, The Intersection,
The Pyramid Scheme, or 20 Monroe Live). I think this might be possible because you have to keep track of what bands are playing
what night and which venue, you have to keep track of how many tickets you sell... you should also have a table for your staff.
However, I wanted to see what you thought about this because initially I wasn't sure if it was a good idea...

-- Some stakeholders for the database would be the concert-goers, promoters who are bringing in the bands,
the staff working at the venue, the bands and their crew...

Update:

I kept the same mindset as above, but instead of doing a database for one concert venue, I expanded it into a database keeping track of multiple concert venues,
the rooms inside those venues, which bands were playing which rooms, and which employees were assigned to which rooms.
