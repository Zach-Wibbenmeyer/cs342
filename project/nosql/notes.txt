CS 342 - Project 5

I implemented the Venue, Room, and Band tables for this part of the project.
For the most part, KVLite is not a great source for implemented my data, mostly because it
can be done much simpler with a SQL database implemented. It was extremely painful trying to get this to work...

The queries I implemented:

1).
	GetVenueRooms: This is a two table join between the Venue and Room tables. This can be useful
	for promoters or employees who are looking to schedule their band or worker, but do not know which rooms
	are in which venues. This useful two table join will display cleanly all of the rooms in each venue, given what the user enters.
	
2).
	GetSortedInceptionOfBands: This is an ordered list that displays all of the bands
	in the database from earliest inception to most recent inception. Although this may have
	no real important use, I thought it would be a fun list to do if you wanted to impress your friends
	with your band knowledge, or, if you were at a concert and the band on state said "Yo dudes, we're totally
	going to give a free CD to anyone who can guess what year we started playing! We promise!".
