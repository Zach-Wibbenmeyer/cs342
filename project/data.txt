All of the data I used was generated by generatedata.com. This was just for the sole purpose of obtaining a large amount of data sets to query against.

This schema should be in 4NF by design, as it is appropriate to do so.

Venue:
	Non-Trivial Superkeys:
		ID
	Non-Trivial Functional Dependencies:
		ID -> name, streetName, city, state, zipcode

Room:
	Non-Trivial Superkeys:
		ID
	Non-Trivial Functional Dependencies:
		ID -> name, capacity, ticketsRemaining

Band:
	Non-Trivial Superkeys:
		ID
	Non-Trivial Functional Dependencies:
		ID -> name, hometownCity, hometownState, genre, members, inception, albums

BandBooking:
	Non-Trivial Superkeys:
		bandID, roomID
	Non-Trivial Functional Dependencies:
		bandID, roomID -> startDate, endDate

Employee:
	Non-Trivial Superkeys:
		ID
	Non-Trivial Functional Dependencies:
		ID -> firstName, lastName, hireDate, streetName, city, state, zipcode

EmployeeBooking:
	Non-Trivial Superkeys:
		employeeID, roomID
	Non-Trivial Functional Dependencies:
		employeeID, roomID -> startDate, endDate

Since there are no non-trivial functional dependencies that don't have a superkey on their left side, my schema should be in BCNF...
However, there are two multi-valued dependencies in my schema within the BandBooking and EmployeeBooking tables. But, because these tables have a superkey as their left sides, my schema is also in 4NF.
